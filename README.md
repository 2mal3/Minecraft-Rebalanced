- Inspired by [Stoo's Subtle Survival Improvements](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/stoo-s-subtle-survival-improvements-combat-health-mobs-recipes-exploration/)([Suspicious Stoo](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/suspicious_stoo/)), [True Survival Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/true-survival-a-hardcore-minecraft-experience/)([Devons_Desk](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/devons_desk/)), [Better Loot Tables](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/better-loot-tables-mobs-structures-blocks/)([Aceplante](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/aceplante/))
- Not tested with Forge, Bukkti, Spigot and PaperSpigot but probably don't work
