## 🗒️ Notes:
- Tested for Fabric and Vanilla in 1.19
- Inspired by [Stoo's Subtle Survival Improvements](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/stoo-s-subtle-survival-improvements-combat-health-mobs-recipes-exploration/) from [Suspicious Stoo](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/suspicious_stoo/) and [True Survival Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/true-survival-a-hardcore-minecraft-experience/) from [Devons_Desk](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/devons_desk/)
- Not tested with Forge, Bukkti, Spigot and PaperSpigot but probably don't work
